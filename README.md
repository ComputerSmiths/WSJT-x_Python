# WSJT-x_Python
Python code to massage WSJT-x files

There are three programs:

FindGaps.py - Find the gaps in the waterfall, even when not visible.

hist.py - Show histograms of Audio frequency, SNR, and dT from ALL.TXT

Distance.py - Silly metric: How many miles of QSOs did you accumulate each year?

Feel free to email wpns@geekho.com with questions, comments, or concerns.
